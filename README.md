# hackmud-tools

Random assortment of tools and scripts for hackmud with comments.

## What's up with the syntax?

Hackmud has a mechanic that limits the size of scripts you can upload by character count.
This means you'll often have to Code Golf your scripts to a very intense degree. To that
end, you'll notice I forego semi-colons and any braces I can get away with leaving out.

Several of these scripts were written when I was working with 500-1100 character limits.

On a related note, I've included the character count (as reported by Hackmud's `#up` method)
and `security_level` for each script.

**NOTE**: While whitespace and single-line comments (`//`) don't count against the limits
block comments (`/* */`) do, so you will want to remove the JSDoc comments prior to uploading.
These comments are designed to make it easier to work with the code.
